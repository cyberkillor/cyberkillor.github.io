I am a Software Engineer currently at [TEMU](https://www.temu.com/), searchrec team. Previously, I focused on online ranking service, mainly on model serving, including CVR/CTR/LLM. Now I am working at machine learning training framework, targing at faster than open source framework like [HugeCTR SOK](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/HugeCTR) or [DeepRec](https://github.com/DeepRec-AI/DeepRec).

I got my bachelor degree from Computer Science and Technology Department at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Since I worked at High Performance Center and [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), I'm passionate about GPU programming and MLsys.

In my spare time, I enjoy soccer and delicious food. One coffee A day makes me strong.
